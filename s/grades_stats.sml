Instead of comparing each grade, you can combine them together. To do this, I average (x-mean)/std. The result of this formula should be gaussian distributed around 0. The standart deviation is a big more complicated. Since each initial distribution has a width of 1, the average distribution has a width of 1/sqrt(N) with the number of exams N (Assuming independent gaussian variables, the sum of N variables has a standart deviation of sqrt(N), and since I divide by N to get the average, this results in 1/sqrt(N)). To make this more easily comparable, I multiply the average by sqrt(N), to get a comparison value that is normal distributed with a standart deviation of 1.
For my master studies, this results in a score of 1.4, while for bachelor studies it is 0.4 and for both together 1.16.[n][n]

If you ignore, that assuming uncorrelated exams, aswell as perfectly gaussian grade distributions, migth have chanced the statistics a bit, you can use this as a z value, and deduce that on average you expect 8% of students to have better grades than me (in my masters, for my bachelors this increases to 34% and in total to ~12%)
