[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

Knowing any object oriented programming language kind of means knowing every oop, but this also means, that there is some hurdle in working with another oop. This I had, when I needed to learn python for university (Even though I learned programming in [LI whyvbasic:visual basicNK]). And so I did all my Data analysis in self written visual basic modules. And even though writing them made me learn a lot about statistics, as the statistics went more complicated, rewriting everything became comically much work. So I started working in python and when I started doing machine learning, there was no longer much of a choice. And I will be honest, I kindof fell in love with python. If we ignore that I am way to much annoyed by writing ''self.'' in each class, python has everything that I ever wanted to have: fstrings, list comprehension and generators are awesome. Top this of by eval(), decorators and even multiple inheritance and the last time I started visual basic was completely by accident and month ago.
