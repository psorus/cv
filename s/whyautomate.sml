[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

Instead of being easily able to measure how well I am at automatisation, it is
less a scill and more a passion. Next to being the reason for a lot of things in
  my git, it also means, that instead of doing something repetitive for a long
  time, I try to automate it. In fact, if you look at the git for this CV, you
  find that it is not just text, for a whole module to generate CV's.
