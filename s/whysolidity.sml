It is often sayed that each object oriented programming language is basically the same. This is why I dont list that I could write ruby or java, but solidity is a little different. Instead of writing huge and complicated modules, even masterful solidity looks at first glance like beginner ones, since more complicated modules are drastically more expensive. This and some special features make solidity interesting, but if you ask me, the true interesting part is the idea of blockchain programming itself.
