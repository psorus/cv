[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]


I would never dare to say I am great at C++, not since there are so many complicated features to C++, but because I do not enjoy writing C++ as much ad I enjoy writing [LI whypython:pythonNK] or [LI whyvbasic:visual basicNK]. That being said, I payed for much of my studies by teaching other students C++. But if I was able to do this, just because the syntax is similar to solidity and the inherit features are similar to visual basic I do not know, but I also do not really care about.
