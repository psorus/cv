[LINK cv:Back to CV][n]


I would never dare to say I am great at C++, not since there are so many complicated features to C++, but because I do not enjoy writting C++ as much ad I enjoy writing [LINK whypython:python] or [LINK whyvbasic:visual basic]. That beeing said, I payed for much of my studies by teaching other students C++. But if I was able to do this, just because the syntax is similar to solidity and the inherit features are similar to visual basic I do not know, but I also do not really care about.
