When I first started to need statistics for my studies, I did not want to change
my programming language (at the time [LI whyvbasic:visual basicNK]), so I
implemented every function I needed myself. And since I than had a much deeper
understanding the functions I was using, i soon started to automate most
statistical question.
[n]Even though this probably kind of stupid, as I spend much more time
automating than I would have needed (and the people reading my results really
did not like my automated file system), this made me think much more about how
to use each function than most of my fellow students did.
[n]There are not very many statistics courses at m old university, so it took
some time until I took a more complicated statistical lecture. And the biggest
drawback was, that this lecture collided with not only 1, but 2 different
lectures I wanted to take, both sadly having higher priority than statistics. I
took the lecture anyway, but without attending the actual lecture and I am way
to proud of me not only passing, but of me finishing as third best in my semester (see [LI grades:my gradesNK]).
