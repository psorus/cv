[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

I call this skill sympy, because that is the probably most common python library, but what I mean with this is more computational algebra. I have some kind of faszination, that maybe stems from me enyoing to write complicated polymorphic programs and my interrested in [LI whyautomate:automatizationNK]. Usually sympy does not give me enough control about each function (Even though it was very useful in some university homeworks) and I like writing my own modules. For one of these modules look at the project labeled ''f'' in my github
