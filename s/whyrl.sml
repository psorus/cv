[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

I have never had to work with Reinforcement Learning (since there are not many obvious applications to physics), but I have a bit more experience than just professional curiosity: I guess you can say that I know the basics (I am able to use a Q learning algorithm, but without literature not much more)

You can also find an Openai gym task in my github (blackjackfinite)
