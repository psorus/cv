[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

When I say I am interested in block chains, then I definitely don't mean
investing into block chains and also not even the idea of digital safe currency. In fact, Bitcoin still seems kind of interesting, but only on a technical level. My fascination for blockchain technologies comes nearly completely from ethereum, the ability to execute code on a blockchain (see [LI whysolidity:solidityNK]) and the possibilities that this could bring to a crafty programmer. Sadly there are still some things missing from ethereum, but I try to keep somewhat up to date
