Web scraping is more a necessarily for me, than a skill, since being able to use any data you find online for whatever you want to do with it allows you to write much more programs. For an example see auditor in my git, which is based on an information stream that I found on a website. Next to pressing F12, I have also worked with understanding website text and when this does not work, with selenium.
