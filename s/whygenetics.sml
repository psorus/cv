[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

Evolutionary programming is more an instinct than a skill. Whenever usual
machine learning (gradient descent) does not work, simple mutating a result is
usually my first idea. To this end, I wrote a simple python package (see
xevo in my github) and I have been using it a lot in the last  time (see the rest of my github)
By now, xevo is no longer just a simple tool, but uses the extensibility implemented into it to serve some more advanced features and I have grown withit.
This extensibility definitely encurages experimentation, and so there are also now some more creative and powerful features.
