[LI cv:Back to CVNK][n]

I think you never forget your first programming language. In fact I dont have many memories that date back before the time, my physics teacher showed us java script and I was so hooked that I went to the library and got the only beginner book about programming they had: A book about visual basic. I think nowadays its kind of a joke language: Mostly used to write microsoft office macros and the only people I have ever met that are able to write it, are engineering students who hate it. And I see why: For most of the time I used it, it was windows exclusive and it has a cousin (which is actually exactly the same, but with other syntax) c# which is more similar to usual progamming languages and thus much more used. But for me visual basic has a special charm: Windows exclusive also means that you are super easily able to use windows features and its inheritance system is just a bit better than every other inheritance system I have ever seen(or at least it seems that way to me).
Sadly it is not really able to compete with [LI whypython:pythonNK] and so I have not written visual basic in quite some time.
