<div><br><br><br>When I first started to need statistics for my studies, I did not want to change<br>my programming language (at the time <a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/whyvbasic.html">visual basic</a>), so I<br>implemented every function I needed myself. And since I than had a much deeper<br>understanding the functions I was using, i soon started to automate most<br>statistical question.<br><br>Even though this probably kind of stupid, as I spend much more time<br>automating than I would have needed (and the people reading my results really<br>did not like my automated file system), this made me think much more about how<br>to use each function than most of my fellow students did.<br><br>There are not very many statistics courses at m old university, so it took<br>some time until I took a more complicated statistical lecture. And the biggest<br>drawback was, that this lecture collided with not only 1, but 2 different<br>lectures I wanted to take, both sadly having higher priority than statistics. I<br>took the lecture anyway, but without attending the actual lecture and I am way<br>to proud of me not only passing, but of me finishing as third best in my semester (see <a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/grades.html">my grades</a>).<br><br><br><br></div>
