<div><br><a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html">Back to CV</a><br><br><br><br>I would never dare to say I am great at C++, not since there are so many complicated features to C++, but because I do not enjoy writing C++ as much ad I enjoy writing <a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/whypython.html">python</a> or <a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/whyvbasic.html">visual basic</a>. That being said, I payed for much of my studies by teaching other students C++. But if I was able to do this, just because the syntax is similar to solidity and the inherit features are similar to visual basic I do not know, but I also do not really care about.<br><br><br><br></div>
