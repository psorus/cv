I would never dare to say I am great at C++, not since there are so many complicated features to C++, but because I do not enjoy writting C++ as much ad I enjoy writing <a href="file:///C:/Users/User/gits/cv/site/s/whypython.html">python</a> or <a href="file:///C:/Users/User/gits/cv/site/s/whyvbasic.html">visual basic</a>. That beeing said, I payed for much of my studies by teaching other students C++. But if I was able to do this, just because the syntax is similar to solidity and the inherit features are similar to visual basic I do not know, but I also do not really care about.
