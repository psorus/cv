When I say I am interrested in blockchains, then I definitely dont mean investing into blockchains and also not even the idea of digital safe currency. In fact, Bitcoin still seems kind of interresting, but only on a technical level. My faszination for blockchain technologies comes neirly completely from Ethereum, the ability to execute code on a blockchain (see <a href="file:///C:/Users/User/gits/cv/site/s/whysolidity.html">solidity</a>) and the possibilities that this could bring to a crafty programmer. Sadly there are still some things missing from ethereum, but I try to keep somewhat up to date
