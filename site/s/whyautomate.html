<div><br><a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html">Back to CV</a><br><br><br>Instead of being easily able to measure how well I am at automatisation, it is<br>less a scill and more a passion. Next to being the reason for a lot of things in<br>  my git, it also means, that instead of doing something repetitive for a long<br>  time, I try to automate it. In fact, if you look at the git for this CV, you<br>  find that it is not just text, for a whole module to generate CV's.<br><br><br></div>
