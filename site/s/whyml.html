<div><br><a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html">Back to CV</a><br><br><br>From the things you usually consider ML, I guess I have trained pretty much all<br>(Classifier, Regression Networks, Dense Models, Convolutional and Graph layers<br>aswell as Autoencoder and GAN's, my biggest weakness might be recurrent stuff where I have only a limited amount of experience) in tensorflow and keras.<br><br>That being said, training a specific model is often as easy as copying an example and you only become good by being able to understand what it is that your model is doing and by getting a feeling for hyperparameters, in short by training a lot of models and I have trained thousands if not tens of thousands of them (depending on how you count). <br><br>Still I would not call myself good at machine learning, if it would not have been for my supervisor, suggesting me to write a fairly advanced model from scratch (Resulting in a package that I call now <a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/goto_grapa.html">grapa</a>). This made me learn a lot about how to build custom layers in tensorflow/keras and, when I compare how I wrote these layers at the beginning of my thesis, and how I wrote them later on, I think being less confused by the manipulation of high dimensional tensors is very useful.<br><br><br></div>
