Website programming is something that can be faszinating and at which I have some experience. In fact I have tried probably every classical language. There was a time I wrote web apis for my visual basic code, and I did this in php. Javascript was the language I wrote my first program in and html is the inspiration for the markup language I wrote to write my master thesis in (I guess see git). But I guess the best summary would be: I wrote this CV.
