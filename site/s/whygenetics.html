<div><br><a href="http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html">Back to CV</a><br><br><br>Evolutionary programming is more an instinct than a skill. Whenever usual<br>machine learning (gradient descent) does not work, simple mutating a result is<br>usually my first idea. To this end, I wrote a simple python package (see<br>xevo in my github) and I have been using it a lot in the last  time (see the rest of my github)<br>By now, xevo is no longer just a simple tool, but uses the extensibility implemented into it to serve some more advanced features and I have grown withit.<br>This extensibility definitely encurages experimentation, and so there are also now some more creative and powerful features.<br><br></div>
