\lettercontent{Dear Dr. Weniger,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{i am currently looking for a PHD position, and the one you advertise \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://www.uva.nl/en/content/vacancies/2020/12/20-766-phd-position-on-dark-matter-theory-astroparticle-physics-and-machine-learning.html?origin=FpX8Wqb2Sua7FLtTRS6KDw}{here}} is quite interesting to me. I would like to pursue a career in academics, and your advertised positions allows me to combine things I already know about with things I would like to know more about.
}


   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my master studies combined with my technical abilities I believe that I can provide significant value to your research while providing me invaluable experience to prepare me for my future career.
But even though I have been fascinated by dark matter searches for a long time, I think my more important skill lies in the machine learning part of your job offer. 
In own projects and my theses, I have applied knowledge of machine learning and especially anomaly detection to for example finding new physics symptoms.
Next to my familiarity with tensorflow and keras, I also have experience with genetic programming and statistics. A more complete list of my interests can be seen in my \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html}{CV}}.
Combining these tools with my physical background, I hope to be able to help your group answer some interesting questions.
}



% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

\lettercontent{Thank you for reading my cover letter and for considering me for this position.}
