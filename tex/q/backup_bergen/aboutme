If I want to give you a good overview about who I am, I should start with the time I got my first laptop. I was 14 at this time, and before I was 15, I became a quite capable programmer. From there I was hooked, spend way to much time trying to write arbitrary code and adopted a mentality in which, whenever I have a problem, I try to solve it through a nice piece of code. When it became time to choose what I want to study, informatics seemed like an obvious choice, but also like a fairly predictable one. I wanted something more challenging and so I started to study physics. And even though I think I faired quite well, programming did not leave me alone and so I choose to use my bachelorthesis (see here) to learn about a new concept that I did not know much about, namely machine learning. And after doing this, and passing the exams required for a masters degree in theoretical particle physics (and also in experimental particle physics as a backup and in theoretical and experimental astro physics because there interesting), this allowed me to write a masters thesis between theoretical jet physics and machine learning. Namely I wrote about using anomaly detection algorithms to find non SM jets.
