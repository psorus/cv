I am interrested in your position, since it allows me to combine the two fields I am interrested in the most. Finding a machine learning phd position migth be fairly easy, but combining them with a particle physics application is much more rare, and just adding theoretical approaches is enough to make me want to apply. And not only this, but you also want me to do jet physics and new physics searches, which I am interrested in very much. I also think your dual supervision approach is a great idea, since I know how hard it can be not to have somebody to supervise you in your coding. Also teaching responsibilities are a must for me, since I thorougly enjoy them. Finally I like to use my doctoral studies to learn a different language and I think your position would allow me to do so quite well.
