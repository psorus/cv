Considering what you expect from a successful candidate, I think migth fit well to you:

I finished my Masters degree in theoretical particle physics (This degree is sadly not attached yet, since it is currently still getting printed, but you find my grades in my CV and I will email you a copy as soon as I have it), which includes some knowledge of quantum field theory. I may have less experience in nuclear physics, but I hope my interest in it can balance this out. Even more strong migth be my computational skill, as I am a competent programmer and I have some experience in most areas of machine learning, including a thesis between jet physics and machine learning. I am also able to work alone quite good, asweel as in a team. I dont speak norwegian, but I would like to learn it (learning a new language is a personal goal pfor my phd studies) and I speak english quite well (Considering your formal requirements, they are not very clear. \href{}{Here} you note that EU/EEA countries (like for example germany) are excempt from profing english skills formally, but here \href{}{Here} you list Germany as requiring an english test [even though there is an asterix, that I dont find explained anywhere]. I just interpret this as I do not have to prove that I speak english, and point out that I did my Master studies in english).
