Let me first just write this a simple list:

Applicants must hold a Masters degree:
    My masters thesis is finished and handed in, and I just await my professor to grade it (see ...)

Experience in theoretical particle physics
    After my thesis is graded, I hold a masters degree in theoretical particle physics

Experience in nuclear physics
    Only basic knowledge, but strong interrest

Knowledge of quantum field theory
    Quantum field theory courses were a requirement for my masters thesis and I passed them fairly well. That beeing said, I did not really need quantum field theory for my masters thesis and so it has been some time since I used it/I migth be a little rusty

Basic programming knowledge
    I would say I have quite good programming knowledge

Experience in ML/AI
    I have experience in most areas of machine learning

Ability to work independently
    Soft skills are fairly hard to prove, but corona gave me fairly good experience in working alone

Ability to work collaborative
    Before corona times, I prefered to do my work with friends (when possible), since this was always more efficient and enjoyable then working alone

Norwegian Language
    I do not speak any norwegian at all, but I am strongly interrested in learning it (Learning a new language would be a definite benefit for me to write my phd in a foreign country)

English Language
    Your requirements are not very clear here. I interpret this () as you do not requiring formal proof for european countries (mostly since I am not really able/willing to spend that much money on a formal test), but if I intepret this wrongly please tell me. In anyway I believe to be very proficient  using the english language. My master studies were completely in english, I wrote and defended my thesis in english and in my head I think about things about as often in english as I do in my mothers language german.
