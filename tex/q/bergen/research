When talking about my former reasearch, the most important part should be my masters thesis. I wrote this thesis, about the possibility of using anomaly detection to find those jets that are not characterised by standard model interactions. I was working in a group who only recently started using ML and so I got a task that was as interresting as it was hard. I should use autoencoder to classify anomalies and try to include a special kind of neuronal network (graph neuronal networks) into this autoencoder. Graph networks make it hard to build an autoencoder from them, so this took some time, in which I learned to write keras networks that are not just convolutions(dense) layers stacked. My final code is available in a python package (here). Given these graph autoencoder, it became clear that the true difficulty does not lie in the application of graph networks, but in the initial idea of using an autoencoder, since they are only able to find a specific set of anomalies. I spend the rest of my thesis producing an anomaly detector that is able to find much more general anomalies. You can see a nice comparison graph at the end of my abstract here.
