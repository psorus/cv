I migth not think that anomaly detection is ready to find new physics jets, but the parts of my masters thesis are still qite interresting to me. I think particle physics can benefit alot from the automatisability and ingeniuety of good machine learning (see feyn). I believe that a good anomaly detection algorithm can allow you to solve much more general problems then supervised algorithms (see ...). And I also quite like the way graphs allow you to think about certain structures, like for example ().
