\lettercontent{Dear Prof. Katzy,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{i am currently looking for a PHD position, and the one you advertise \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://www.desy.de/career/job_offers/index_eng.html?joboffer=114251}{here}} is quite interesting to me. I would like to pursue a career between particle physics and machine learning, and your advertised position would allow me to nicely combine things I already know about with things I would like to learn more about.
}


   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my master studies, combined with my technical abilities, I also believe that I can provide significant value to your research group, while providing me invaluable experience to prepare me for my future career.

In (my own projects and) my theses, I have applied knowledge of machine learning and especially anomaly detection to (for example) finding new physics symptoms in jet events.

Generative models are quiet interesting to me, and since they are sometimes surprisingly similar to anomaly detection algorithms, I have some experience there too (see for example \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/psorus/anogen}{here}} or \textcolor{blue}{\href{https://grapa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tipsy.html}{here}}).

Next to my familiarity with tensorflow and keras, I also have experience with genetic programming and statistics. A more complete list of my interests/skills can be seen in my \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://www.psorus.de//s/cv.html}{CV}}.

My interest in particle physics resulted in me not only writing my masters thesis about it, but I also took every course covering theoretical and experimental particle physics offered by my university (see \textcolor{blue}{\href{http://www.psorus.de//s/grades.html}{here}}).

}



% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position.
