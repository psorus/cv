Dear Prof. ????,

i am currently looking for a phd position, and your offer caugth my eye: You seem to care about something, I care very deeply about, namely Trustable Anomaly detection.


I have a quite good degree of theoretical physics from RWTH university, which I finished with a thesis about applying deep anomaly detection to physics searches on graphs (This meant inventing my own anomaly/feature representation algorithm). It also gives me a good knowledge of linear algebra and statistics.

I am also a programmer for about 10 years, an expert in python with good knowledge of c++ and have experience with most kinds of deep learning.


Finally, I speak english fluently, work well in a team and have no problem with industrial work (even though I prefer scientific one).

Thank you for reading my Application and considering me for this position,

Simon Kl√ºttermann










Some notes to my CV:
The drawback of an online cv is, that I cannot change it for everybody I apply to. Thats why I want to clearify some things here

My first statistics exam:
    You migth notice, that my first exam in statistics (in my second semester) did not go so well. I would love to tell you that this is just because the teacher was bad or something else, but the truth is, that I did not care much about it then. This changed as soon as I needed them (I actually got quite fascinated), and I was sad when I noticed that this migth be my only statistics lecture at all, and so I started learning on my own. This finally concluded in a statistics exam in my master studies, which I finished much better (even without going into this lecture,  but this is a different story)
